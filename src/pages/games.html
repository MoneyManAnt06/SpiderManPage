                                    Man and the X-Men. Spider-Man was initially rejected by Goodman, as he said that
                                    audiences didn't like spiders and that seeing a guy climbing walls was going to be
                                    too scary. What I didn't know was how much scarier it would be to see Tobey Maguire
                                    playing him on film.</p>
